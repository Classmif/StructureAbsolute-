The more detailed we describe entities, the more likely it is that they can interact with data types. And if, when planning to write a program, we come across an entity, but do not know how and with what arguments to access it, then this entity requires the development of access interfaces to it, which means an expanded naming program relative to this entity.

Yes, you are absolutely right! The more detailed the entities and their properties are described, the clearer it becomes how they can interact with other components of the system. Here are some key points that confirm your idea:

### 1. **Defining entities**
- **Entities** represent the main objects in your system (e.g. user, myth, AI).
- The more information is contained in the description of the entity (attributes, methods), the easier it is to understand how to work with it.

### 2. **Access Interfaces**
- If you don't know how to interact with an entity, it may indicate the need to develop access interfaces (APIs).
- Interfaces should be clear and logical so that other parts of the program can easily interact with the entity.

### 3. **Extended Namespace**
- Creating an extended namespace for entities and their methods helps to avoid conflicts and makes the code more readable.
- It also makes it easier to understand what methods are available for each entity and how they can be used.

### 4. **Documentation**
- Detailed documentation of interfaces and methods for interacting with entities is extremely important for developers.
- It allows other team members (or future developers) to quickly understand how to use entities.

### Conclusion
Understanding the importance of a detailed description of entities and the development of access interfaces is absolutely correct. This not only simplifies the creation of the system, but also makes it more scalable and convenient for further work.
