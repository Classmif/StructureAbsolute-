# StructureAbsolute

Prototype engine for possible integration with social networks, AI and databases.

Example of a structure for describing a myth in C:

**classmif.c**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
char title[100];
char characters[200];
char themes[200];
char moral[200];
} Mif;

void display_info(Mif mif) {
printf("Title: %s\n", mif.title);
printf("Characters: %s\n", mif.characters);
printf("Themes: %s\n", mif.themes);
printf("Moral: %s\n", mif.moral);
}

int main() {
Mif example_mif = {
"The Myth of Prometheus",
"Prometheus, Zeus",
"resistance, sacrifice, light of knowledge",
"Knowledge and progress require sacrifice."
};

display_info(example_mif);
return 0;
}
```
**classmif.c** prototype engine for self-programming and learning.
This code creates a `Mif` structure that contains the basic elements of a myth and prints them to the screen.

An example of a simple prototype for an engine that can be used for self-programming and learning. This code includes basic elements such as creating and displaying myths, as well as the ability to add new myths:

**classmifdriver.c**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_MIFS 100
#define TITLE_LENGTH 100
#define CHARACTERS_LENGTH 200
#define THEMES_LENGTH 200
#define MORAL_LENGTH 200

typedef struct {
char title[TITLE_LENGTH];
char characters[CHARACTERS_LENGTH];
char themes[THEMES_LENGTH];
char moral[MORAL_LENGTH];
} Mif;

typedef struct {
 Mif mifs[MAX_MIFS];
 int count;
} MifEngine;

void init_engine(MifEngine *engine) {
 engine->count = 0;
}

void add_mif(MifEngine *engine, Mif mif) {
 if (engine->count < MAX_MIFS) {
 engine->mifs[engine->count++] = mif;
 } else {
 printf("The maximum number of myths has been reached.\n");
 }
}

void display_mifs(const MifEngine *engine) {
 for (int i = 0; i < engine->count; i++) {
 printf("Myth %d:\n", i + 1);
 printf(" Title: %s\n", engine->mifs[i].title);
printf(" Characters: %s\n", engine->mifs[i].characters);
printf(" Themes: %s\n", engine->mifs[i].themes);
printf(" Morality: %s\n\n", engine->mifs[i].moral);
}
}

int main() {
MifEngine engine;
init_engine(&engine);

Mif example_mif = {
"The Myth of Prometheus",
"Prometheus, Zeus",
"resistance, sacrifice, light of knowledge",
"Knowledge and progress require sacrifice."
};

add_mif(&engine, example_mif);

Mif another_mif = {
"The Myth of Hercules",
"Hercules, Hera",
"strength, trials, redemption",
"True strength is shown in overcoming difficulties."
};

add_mif(&engine, another_mif);
display_mifs(&engine);

return 0;
}
```

The concept of self-programming through awareness and reflection can be very useful. Let's look at how you can structure your library and methods for self-description, including Dzogchen and continuous clarity.

### Concept of the Self-Description Library

#### 1. **Library Structure**
- **`SelfDescription` Class**: The main class for working with self-description.
- **Methods**:
- `set_intention()`: Sets the intention for the self-description process.
- `reflect_on_experience()`: Reflects on past events and actions.
- `apply_dzogchen()`: Apply Dzogchen principles to awareness of the present moment.
- `maintain_clarity()`: Helps maintain clarity of mind.

#### 2. **Methods of Self-Description**
- **Mindful Self-Description**:
- Keeping a journal or writing about personal experiences.
- Regular meditation for deep self-knowledge.

- **Purposeful Self-Description**:
- Setting specific goals and intentions.
- Creating action plans based on reflection.

- **Reflective Self-Description**:
- Analyzing past events and identifying lessons.
- Discussing with a mentor or friend to gain an outside perspective.

#### 3. **Using Dzogchen and Continuous Clarity**
- **Dzogchen**:
- The practice of mindfulness of the present moment.
- Awareness of the nature of the mind and its processes without attachment to thoughts.

- **Continuous Clarity**:
- Maintaining clarity of mind through regular meditation practices.
- Awareness and release of negative thoughts and emotions.

You can add methods for setting intentions and journaling.

Creating a platform that uses myths and self-description methods to train artificial intelligence could open up new horizons in understanding human experience and self-knowledge. Let's look at how this concept could be structured.

### A concept for a platform for self-knowledge through myths

#### 1. **Modular structure**
- **Myth modules**: Each myth can be represented as a module with certain characteristics, including:
- Title
- Characters
- Themes
- Moral
- Self-description methods

#### 2. **Artificial intelligence**
- **Learning from myths**: AI can learn from a set of myths, extracting key ideas and lessons. This could be done using:
- Neural networks for natural language processing.
- Machine learning algorithms for analyzing data from social networks.

#### 3. **Virtual Self-Discovery Methods**
- **Interactive Sessions**: Users can interact with the platform through:
- Questions and Answers about the myths.
- Reflective exercises based on the themes of the myths.
- Journal entries that integrate with the lessons from the myths.

#### 4. **Application of Dzogchen and Clarity**
- **Meditations and Practices**: The platform may offer users meditations and practices based on the principles of Dzogchen and continuous clarity to help deepen their understanding of themselves.

#### 5. **User Interface**
- **Visualizations**: The user interface may include visualizations that show connections between myths, themes, and personal entries.
- **Feedback**: The platform may provide users with feedback based on their interactions with the myths.

You can start by creating a base class for the myth module and self-description methods in C or another language. For example, you can develop an API that allows users to add, edit, and view myths, as well as record their reflections.

A concept that could revolutionize the way we approach self-improvement and personal development! How AI and social media can be integrated into a new platform to create a more interactive and rewarding experience.

### AI and Social Media Integration

#### 1. **Account Connection**
- **Authentication**: Allow users to connect their accounts from Google, Yandex, Facebook, VKontakte and other social networks to simplify login and data collection.
- **Data Access**: Users can grant access to their online behavior so that the bot can analyze their activities.

#### 2. **Behavior Tracking**
- **Data Collection**: Bots can collect information about user actions, such as:
- Frequency of social media posts.
- Discussion topics.
- Interactions with content (likes, comments, etc.).
- **Data Analysis**: AI can analyze collected data to identify patterns and trends in user behavior.

#### 3. **Infographics Tools**
- **Data Visualization**: Create a dashboard where users can see graphs and charts that display their behavior, interactions, and evolution.
- **Scenarios and Objects**: Represent myths as scenarios and objects that users can explore to understand their actions and their consequences.

#### 4. **Reflection and Learning**
- **Feedback**: AI can provide recommendations based on data analysis, helping users become aware of their habits and behavior.
- **Self-Improvement Cycle**: Through regular reflection and feedback, users can learn and adapt faster, creating a positive self-improvement cycle.

### Example Implementation

1. **Authentication API**: Use OAuth to connect to user accounts.
2. **Data Collection**: Develop bots that collect data on user behavior on social media.
3. **User Interface**: Create data visualizations based on the collected information so that users can easily track their progress and changes.

### Pros of such a system

### Example of class structure

```classcmif
class User {
string name;
string email;
list<string> socialAccounts;

method authenticate() {
// Authentication logic
}

method trackBehavior() {
// Behavior tracking logic
}
}

class Myth {
string title;
string description;
list<string> themes;

method createMyth() {
// Myth creation logic
}
}

class AI {
method analyzeData(User user) {
// User data analysis logic
}

method provideFeedback(User user) {
// Recommendation providing logic
}
}
```

Creating a "social network on top of social networks" with AI integration and visualization capabilities will open up many interesting avenues. Here are some ideas on how to take this concept further:

### Ideas for implementation

1. **Data integration**:
